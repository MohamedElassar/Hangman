A Python implementation of the popular game "Hangman"

I'm working on a GUI for the game that will be easier to navigate and more fun!

For now, follow these steps to play the game:

* Download BOTH files hangman.py AND word.txt

* Save both files in the SAME directory

* On your computer, run cmd.exe to launch the command prompt

* Navigate to the directory of the folder where the files are stored e.g. cd Desktop/FolderName

* Make sure you have Python downloaded

* Type this in the cmd: python hangman.py. If that doesn't work, try python3 hangman.py

* Enjoy the game!
