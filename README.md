# Hangman
A Python implementation of the popular Hangman game

I'm working on a GUI for the game that will be easier to navigate and more fun!

For now, this is how you play the game:
# Download BOTH files hangman.py AND word.txt
# Save both files in the SAME directory
# On your computer, run cmd.exe to launch the command prompt
# Navigate to the directory of the folder where the files are stored e.g. cd Desktop/FolderName
# Make sure you have Python downloaded
# Type this in the cmd: python hangman.py. If that doesn't work, try python3 hangman.py
# Enjoy the game!
